# Borrd - Markdown Editor

A Next.js application with a Markdown editor that saves content to Supabase and displays it with customizable styling using slugs. Includes image and audio upload support via Supabase Storage.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

3. Set up your Supabase database with a `pages` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE pages (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  markdown TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

4. Set up Supabase Storage for file uploads:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard â†’ Storage
   - Create two buckets: `images` and `audio`
   - Set both buckets to public (anyone can view)
   - Set the bucket policies to allow public uploads:
```sql
-- Allow public uploads to images bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow public image uploads" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images');

-- Allow public access to view images
CREATE POLICY "Allow public image viewing" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'images');

-- Allow public uploads to audio bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow public audio uploads" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'audio');

-- Allow public access to view audio
CREATE POLICY "Allow public audio viewing" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'audio');
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your published pages
7. Open [http://localhost:3000/editor](http://localhost:3000/editor) to create new pages

## Supabase Setup

   - `videos` (public)

3. Set up storage policies for each bucket:

**For `images` bucket:**
```sql
-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public Access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'images');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload images" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow public uploads (for client-side uploads)
CREATE POLICY "Public uploads for images" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images');
```

**For `audio` bucket:**
```sql
-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public Access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'audio');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload audio" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'audio' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow public uploads (for client-side uploads)
CREATE POLICY "Public uploads for audio" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'audio');
```

**For `videos` bucket:**
```sql
-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public Access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'videos');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload videos" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'videos' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow public uploads (for client-side uploads)
CREATE POLICY "Public uploads for videos" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'videos');
